Change allow_origins to your actual domain(s) before deploying
    Example production value:
        allow_origins=["https://yourapp.com", "https://www.yourapp.com"]

Generate a strong key once:
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
Then set it as an environment variable on your machine/server:
Windows:  setx SECRET_KEY "your-generated-key"
Mac/Linux: export SECRET_KEY="your-generated-key"
